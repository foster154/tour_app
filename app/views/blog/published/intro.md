As the first post of the new Show & Tour blog, I thought it would be useful to take a step back and write about why Show & Tour was created. This will provide a good look into our perspective and priorities as we work to provide you with the best real estate virtual tour software and platform available.

First, a quick introduction:

Meet Mark Foster, and the creator and founder of Show & Tour. I wear many hats here (especially as we are young), and there's a good chance you'll run into me often. I'm passionate about what we do, about real estate in general, and about the potential of value of virtual tours for both home buyers and real estate agents.

A logical question to ask when doing business with a company is *why* they do what they do in the first place. Asking "why" can help you see the heart of a company... where their priorities are, where future product development could lead, and how they will treat their customers. My "why" dates back to when my wife Sarah and I were looking to purchase a home for our (growing) family.

Like most house hunting couples, we scoured the big online listing websites for potential homes in our price range. When we found one that looked interesting, we'd carefully review the pictures and read all the facts we could. Pretty normal stuff. If we were still interested in the home, we'd crave *more* details. We'd look on other sites, we'd do more Google searches for the address, we'd look at Google Street view, and so on.

Occasionally, we'd notice a listing had a virtual tour link. So we'd click on it... and we'd see a new site with the *same* pictures, the *same* description, and where the look and feel felt straight out of the 90's.

I figured there had to be a better way to make virtual tours *valuable*. To make them *worth looking at*. So I got to work.

Show and Tour aims to over-deliver on what a homebuyer expects to see when they click on a virtual tour link. Beautiful, full-screen, high resolution photography- with no limit to the number of photos that can be added. Cutting edge, modern design. A fully responsive layout that immediately adapts to whatever device they are using. 

Along with virtual tours that are valuable for homebuyers, we also strive to serve the real estate agents using our service. We've invested a lot of time creating software that is easy to learn and use. We also know the quality of our design will help sellers (as well as their friends and family) *want* to share the listing to their social networks, getting the agent more high-quality exposure. Additionally, our lead generation tools can help find future clients.

We have big plans to continue pushing in to our vision of adding incredible value to real estate agents and homebuyers through cutting edge virtual tours. Stay tuned!
