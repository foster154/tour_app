As the first post of the new Show & Tour blog, let's take a moment for introductions, and a bit of the story behind how and why Show & Tour was created.

First, by way of introduction, I'm Mark, the founder of Show & Tour.

I came into the world of real estate photography mostly by accident. A friend had read an article about virtual tours in Entrepreneur magazine, and it captured our imagination. It seemed to be a great blend of three of our interests (photography, web design, and real estate), and so we got together and began work on creating a small business.

Though we initially put a lot of effort toward building high-end (and fairly expensive) virtual tours, eventually we realized it was our photography that was generating the most interest from potential clients. We were being booked for more and more real estate photography shoots, but selling fewer virtual tours. Agents loved the innovative tours we created, but couldn't always justify the additional expense.

As a photographer, I loved the idea of the virtual tour. They had the potential to display the photos I took in a *much* more appealing way (full screen and high resolution). They could be built to incorporate panoramas, videos, home specs and neighborhood information. They were simply the best way to experience a home online. 

They also had the possibility of building my reputation as a photographer. A virtual tour had the capability of giving me credit for the photos. Other real estate agents could then notice my work and know how to hire me for their next listing.

The idea began to grow in my head that I wanted *all* of my real estate photography shoots to include a virtual tour. It was a valuable service to the real estate agent, appreciated by home buyers, and helped me get my name out as a photographer and grow my business. Why not include a free virtual tour every time?

I wasn't able to find a virtual tour service that incorporated all these ideas into one package, and was priced in a way that made this feasible. So I got to work.

We are still young, and are working hard to continue to move forward and realize the vision. We love real estate and architecture photographers. You are who we strive to serve, and who we want to hear from in regards to how we can improve.

We'll use this blog to keep you updated on Show & Tour, as well as to deliver helpful tools and advice for growing your real estate photography business. 

We'd love to hear you. You can always send any feedback or suggestions to support@showandtour.com, or drop me a line personally at mark@showandtour.com.
