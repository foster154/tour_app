While photos are still king, video is quickly becoming a critical tool in real estate marketing. With one short video, it is possible to capture the layout and feel of a home in an incredible way.

We know more and more real estate photographers are offering video tours in their range of products, and we are excited for Show and Tour to be the way they deliver their photos and videos for the world to see.

**Getting started is incredibly simple:**

1. Simply upload your video to your favorite video platform (we'll use YouTube for our example, but Vimeo and other platforms work just as well).

2. Your video platfrom will provide you with the "embed code" for your video. Here's where it is found on YouTube:
<div>

3. Paste this embed code into the video area of your Show & Tour virtual tour:

</div>

And that's it! Show & Tour will place your video into your tour, take care of all the resizing necessary to make sure it looks great on whatever sized screen it is viewed with, and add the proper navigation links to the top of the tour. 

If you need any additional help getting adding a video to your next real estate virtual tour, just [let us know](https://www.showandtour.com/contact).
